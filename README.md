- The Grid Cell will be rendered based on the 2D array "config"
- 1 mean cell will be there for selection, 0 means cell wil not be rendered
- The config 2D array can be modified where the value 0 can be placed at different cells indicating that cell will not be rendered
- When clicked on a grid cell, the grid cell lights up i.e turns green
- Once all the available cells are clicked, the Grid Light cells will switch off in the exact reverse order at an interval of 300ms
